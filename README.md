# 🔍 InfraSight

**Multimodal Inspection & Repair Planner**

A production-grade, multimodal inspection assistant that turns photos, videos and scanned spec sheets into localized defect detections, natural-language answers, prioritized repair plans, and prefilled maintenance tickets — built for municipalities, utilities, and field service teams.
